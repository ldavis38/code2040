# Code2040 - Technical Assessment
Overall, this technical assessment was not impossible but it was challenging. Because some of these tasks required me to do things I've never done, I had to read, research, ask for help, code trace, debug, and actually try to problem solve. Sometimes I get so used to programming for school assignments or my own side projects that I'm already comfortable with that I forget that CS has so much to do with problem solving and critical thinking skills. 
I used Python and each step is in a separate .py file.
